[TIP]
====
In this document, all text in a "Tip" block (or inline text with with a ":bulb:" on either side)
MUST be removed and/or replaced with text appropriate to this JEP before submission.

Sections may include additional help and advice in comments.
":bulb:" entries in comments only need to be filled in if that text is uncommented.

See https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/1/README.adoc[JEP-1] for full and accurate description of the JEP process and what is required in each section.
====

[TIP]
====
*BDFL-Delegate* is uncommented by default.
As part of the in initial conversation or the JEP submission the sponsor should
look for a BDFL Delegate.
While not required, it is better for the community if Delegates perform most reviews.
If no suitable BDFL-Delegate can be found, that row may be commented out.

== Abstract

The goal of this JEP is to have the latest status of deprecated word or terms and agreed replacements in a table at one place that can be discussed with history.
The proposal is to have git to keep history of changes, and discussion on new term on PRs.

Deprecated term are written explicitly to be searchable.

== Specification

* The term in table must be in lower case (when the language allows it). 

* To add a new language, propose a PR on top of this JEP by a copy/paste one language (other than English) and add a new section.

* To add a new term in an existing language, propose a PR on top of this JEP with the modified table.

TBD: stands for "To Be Done", it means that there is no community agreement yet. If you have a proposal feel welcome to propose it as a PR or in https://community.jenkins.io/t/jenkins-terminology-cleanup-initiative-coordination/180[Discourse terminology thread]

* Known Exceptions

== Motivation

There is more and more deprecated words and replacement. Discussions and motivations on new term can be done in discussion channels, but once the descision is made by the community we need to have all deprecated terminology and replacement at one place.

As updating terminology is a huge work accross all Jenkins ecosystem, we wish to make it easy for new contributor to help. Having deprecated words to search and replacement face to face make it more easy. Having translations deprecated words and replacements is also more easy for maintainer to review PR that are not in native or spoken language.

== Reasoning

[TIP]
====
Explain why particular design decisions were made.
Describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. For example, how the feature is supported in other systems.
Provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

* Use sub-headings to organize this section for ease of readability.
* Do not talk about history or why this needs to be done - that is part of Motivation section.
====

== Backwards Compatibility

[TIP]
====
Describe any incompatibilities and their severity.
Describe how the JEP proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

If there are no backwards compatibility concerns, this section may simply say:
There are no backwards compatibility concerns related to this proposal.

== Security

There are no security risks related to this proposal.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

[TIP]
====
If the JEP involves any kind of behavioral change to code
(whether in a Jenkins product or backend infrastructure),
give a summary of how its correctness (and, if applicable, compatibility, security, etc.) can be tested.

In the preferred case that automated tests can be developed to cover all significant changes, simply give a short summary of the nature of these tests.

If some or all of the changes will require human interaction to verify them, explain why automated tests are considered impractical.
Then, summarize what kinds of test cases might be required: user scenarios with action steps and expected outcomes.
Detail whether behavior might be different based on the platform (operating system, servlet container, web browser, etc.)?
Are there foreseeable interactions between different permissible versions of components (Jenkins core, plugins, etc.)?
Does this change require that any special tools, proprietary software, or online service accounts to exercise a related code path (e.g., Active Directory server, GitHub login, etc.)?
When will you complete testing relative to merging code changes, and might retesting be required if other changes are made to this area in the future?

If this proposal requires no testing, this section may simply say:
There are no testing issues related to this proposal.
